# UpDateNTime
[![UpDateNTime Logo](UpdateDateNTime/Resources/logoGitHub.png)](#Start-using)

This is **UpDateN'Time**! A program that I made using Visual Basic .NET(for some reason) for 
those people that are unlucky and always need to sync their date and time manually.

## Notice
The original app name was "UpdateDateN'Time", and later was changed to "UpDateNTime", because it looks better. That's why some files still use the old name.
